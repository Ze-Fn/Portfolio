# Notice
I wrote some refelctions and weekly assignment from a cybersecurity bootcamp and stored it in Google Drive. It was so many that I have a hard time converting it to this GitHub repo. I have a plan to consolidate and redesign them into an HTML view. In the mean time, I will drop the link to my Google Drive.

# Interest
After learning from dibimbing.id's Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I found myself interested in Digital Forensics. Therefore, I have added a dedicated directory for Digital Forensics. It contains write-ups, case studies, and many more (I still have yet to explore Digital Forensics to its deepest depth).
