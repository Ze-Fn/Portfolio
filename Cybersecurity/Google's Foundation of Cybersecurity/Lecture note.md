## Week 1
Security: the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

Job responsibilities: 
* Protecting computer and network systems
* Installing prevention software
* Conducting periodic security audits

Protects from external and internal (current or formal employee, external vendors, trusted vendors--which usually incidental) threats.

Daily life of security engineer:
* Operations: responding to detections and doing investigations
* Projects: Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections

Core skills of a security analyst:

Value of security: Meets regulatory compliance (avoiding fines and audits), reduces expenses (in case of data loses, attacks, recovery), maintaining brand trust

Jobs:
* Security analyst or specialist: monitoring networks for breaches, develop strategies to secure an organization, and research information technology (IT) security trends to remain alert and informed about potential threats, prevent incidents.

Importance of cybersecurity:
Disclosure of
* personally identifiable information (PII)

Threat actor types:
* Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
* Insider threat
* Hacktivist

Security Frameworks and Controls
* Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
* Protecting PII
* Securing financial information
* Identifying security weaknesses
* Managing organization risks
* Aligning security with business goals

Core componnetes of security framework:
1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating result

CIA Triad
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

Security Frameworks:
* NIST CSF (Cyber Security Framework)
* NIST RMF (Risk Managemenr Framework)
* The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)
* The Federal Risk and Autrhorization Management Program (FedRAMP(R))
* Center for INternet Security (CIS(R))
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* System and Oraganizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)

Ethics of Security
* Confidentiality
* Privacy protection (always adhere to the policy/regulation)
* Laws

Cybersecurity tools and programming languages
* SIEM tools: collects and analyzes log data
    * Splunk Enterprise
    * Google Chronicle
* Playbooks
    * Chain of custody
    * Protecting and preserving evidence
    * Order of volatility
* Packet sniffers

Portfolio projects
As previously mentioned, you will have multiple opportunities throughout the certificate program to develop items to include in your portfolio. These opportunities include:
* Drafting a professional statement
* Conducting a security audit
* Analyzing network structure and security
* Using Linux commands to manage file permissions
* Applying filters to SQL queries
* Identifying vulnerabilities for a small business
* Documenting incidents with an incident handler’s journal 
* Importing and parsing a text file in a security-related scenario
* Creating or revising a resume

Note: Do not include any private, copyrighted, or proprietary documents in your portfolio. Also, if you use one of the sites described in this reading, keep your site set to “private” until it is finalized.

## Week 2

Threat, Risks, and Vulnerabilities
* Threat: Any event
* Risks: Anything can impact the CIA triad of an asset
    * Low-risk: informations publicly available
    * Medium-risk: Internal data
    * High-risk: Data that should be protected at all cost (laws)
* Strategies to manage risks:
    * Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoiuid disrupting business continuity
    * Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
    * Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
    * Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk
* Vulnerability: Weaknesses

Layers of Web:
1. Surface
2. Deep
3. Dark

Impacts of threats, risks, vulnerabilities:
* Financial
* Identity theft: PII, SPII
* Reputation: Broken trust

NIST RMF
1. Prepare: Manage security and privacy risks before attack happens
2. Categorize: Develop risk management processes and tasks
3. Select: Choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protects the organization.
4. Implement: Implement security and privacy plans for the organization
5. Assess: Determine of established controls are implemented correctly
6. Authorize: being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exists in the organization
7. Monitor: be aware of how systems are operating

Frameworks
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to sensitive data

Controls
Safeguard designed to reduce specific risks
* Encryption
* Authentication
* Authorization 

CIA Triad in depth
* Confidentiality: Only authorized users can see the data
* Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable
* Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it

NIST CSF (universal)
1. Govern
2. Identify: Management of cybersecurity risks and its effect on an organization's people and assets
3. Detect: Identifyin potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections
4. Respond: Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement impovements to the security process
5. Recover: Returning affected system to the normal operation
6. Protect: strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

OWASP
* Minimize attack surface area
* Principle of Least Privilege
* Defense in depth (multiple security controls)
* Separation of duties
* Keep security simple
* Fix security issues correctly

Security audit
A review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.
* External 
* Internal: 
    * Identify organizational risk
    * Assess controls
    * Correct compliance issues

Internal Audit Elements
* Establishing the scope and goals
    > Scope: what are involved in the audit
    > Goals: objective(s) to be achieved
* Conducting a risk assessment
    > Audit questions
    * What is the qudit meant to achieve?
    * Which assets are most at risk?
    * Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
    * What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?
* Completing a controls assessment
    * Administrative controls
    * Technical controls
    * Physical controls
* Assessing compliance
    > Check whether the current security posture has adhered to the compliance
* Communicating results
    > Stakeholder communication:
    * Summarizes the scope and goals
    * Lists existing risks
    * Notes how quickly those risks need to be addressed
    * Identifies compliance regulations
    * Provides recommendations
