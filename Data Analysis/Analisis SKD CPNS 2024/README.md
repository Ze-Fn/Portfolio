# Analyzing Test Result from _Seleksi Kompetensi Dasar_ (SKD) _Calon Pegawai Negeri Sipil_ (CPNS) 2024

# Overview
This __personal analysis project__ was driven by my frustration on failing to pass the SKD CPNS 2024. This frustration then fueled me to plan and prepare strategically for the upcoming (who-knows-when) CPNS. Descriptive statistics analysis result highlights the profile of competitors specifically in the `Master of Education -  English Language Education` (or _S-2 Pendidikan Bahasa Inggris_) field as well as the volume of open position in target institutions. With this in mind, it is recommended to plan ahead based on the selection of target `Institution` and `Formation`.

# Contextual Insight
In Indonesia, the *Calon Pegawai Negeri Sipil* (CPNS) is a competitive national recruitment process to select candidates for civil service positions in government institutions. The *Seleksi Kompetensi Dasar* (SKD), or Basic Competency Test, is a critical stage of the CPNS, assessing candidates' general knowledge, cognitive abilities, and personality traits through three sections: *Tes Wawasan Kebangsaan* (TWK, civic knowledge), *Tes Intelegensia Umum* (TIU, general intelligence), and *Tes Karakteristik Pribadi* (TKP, personality test). Passing the SKD is essential to advance to further stages of the CPNS selection. This analysis focuses on the 2024 SKD results for candidates with a Masterâ€™s degree in English Language Education (*S-2 Pendidikan Bahasa Inggris*), examining their performance and institutional preferences to inform strategic preparation for future CPNS exams.

# Dataset
The dataset that I used was retreived from a Kementerian Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi (Kemendikbudristek) 2024. To clear up the confusion, This Ministry has been split into three ministries as of the new President of Indonesia's declaration. The current equivalent Ministry of the previous Ministry is `Kementerian Pendidikan Tinggi, Sains, dan Teknologi` (_Kemendiktisaintek_).
