## Introduction
This project analyzes the CPNS (Calon Pegawai Negeri Sipil; or Public Civil Servant Candidate) test takers first exam result. CPNS is generally divided into two examinations stage: the first being `SKD` (Seleksi Kompetensi Dasar; or Core Competence Test), and subsequently `SKB` (Seleksi Kompetensi Bidang; or Subject-specific Competence Test). The result from this analysis revealed substantial insights and implications for various parties including future test takers, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology (ministry name casually changes when the President changes), and higher education institutions.

1. How is the difference of total score between S-2 Pendidikan Bahasa Inggris and S-2 Pendidikan Fisika test takers?
2. How is the relationship between test taker's education on TWK (Tes Wawasan Kebangsaan)?
3. How is the relationship between test taker's education on TIU (Tes Intelegensi Umum)?
4. How is the relationship between test taker's education on TWK (Tes Karakteristik Pribadi)?
5. How is the relationship between test taker's education on total SKD score (TWK + TIU + TKP)?
